P4: Tiny File System with FUSE Library

Usage

To start, set the macro “BLOCK_SIZE” in “block.h” to whatever you wish. Make sure that “MAX_DNUM” and “MAX_INUM”  in “tfs.h” are each no more than 8 times “BLOCK_SIZE”, as our file system’s maximum bitmap size is one block. We unfortunately did not have the time (or willpower) to implement bitmaps that span multiple blocks.

Open a command line and type “make” to compile the code. We have edited the makefile to also create directories “/tmp/tmc231_rlc192” and “/tmp/tmc231_rlc192/mountdir”. Please make sure to use the latter name for any test case files.

Mount the filesystem with the command “./tfs -s /tmp/tmc231_rlc192/mountdir”.

Run any tests you like. Note that our “benchmark” directory contains both “simple_test.c” and “test_case.c”, unmodified (we think), and the makefile in “benchmark” has been updated to compile and clean up both.

When finished, unmount the filesystem with the command “fusermount -u /tmp/tmc231_rlc192/mountdir”. Do this before typing “make clean” into the command line so any files do not get deleted! (We don’t think Linux would let you, anyways; when we tried, we got something along the lines of “Device or resource busy”).

Finally, type “make clean”.  This will remove the directories “make” created along with their contents, in addition to the default settings.
